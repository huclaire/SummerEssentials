		<p>In the summer, you want to look and feel your best. So what better way than adding a few new pieces to your wardrobe to boost your confidence! Summer
		clothes can get pretty pricey but that's okay because you&rsquo;ll be saving so much on your inexpensive <a href="wheretotravel.html">summer trips</a>! These are
		a few ideas and suggestions you can use to change your look!</p>

			<li>Puff Sleeve Top</li>
				<p>This top gives off such a great 90&rsquo;s vibe! It&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;ve probably seen Rachel or Monica from Friends wear before.
				Retro and throwback clothes are really coming back in style so this top is such a great choice.</p>
				<p>This specific top is from <a href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com">Urban Outfitters</a>. It currently retails at $54 which is quite expensive, but
				I&rsquo;m quite certain there are many dupes out there.

				<p class="float-left"><img src="acidwashjeanshorts.png" alt="jean shorts" width="200" height="300"/></p>
				<p>Acid wash is such a fun way to add some style to your denim. You could either buy it, or even do it yourself! This jean style will brighten your
				entire outfit and make it so much more fun.</p> 
				<p>These particular jeans are from <a href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com">Urban Outfitters</a> and they cost
				a decent $29.99! I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s a pretty great deal!</p>

				<p>Summer is the only time in our cold country that we can go bare legged and wear dresses. So it&rsquo;s time to take advantage of that and wear as many dresses
				as possible! This puff sleeve dress goes perfectly with the 90&rsquo;s trend and is super comfy!</p>
				<p>This dress is also from <a href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com">Urban Outfitters</a> and costs $49! It&rsquo;s overpriced but I&rsquo;m sure there
				are many other similar, cheaper dresses out there.</p>
